Contributions are very welcome!

We follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

1. **Create a Fork and clone it**

   Simply click on the “fork” button of the repository page on GitHub.

   The standard clone command creates a local git repository from your remote fork on GitHub.

2. **Modify the Code**

   In your local clone, modify the code and commit them to your local clone using the git commit command.

   Run `npm test` and make sure all tests still pass.

   Run `tslint --project .` and make sure you get no warnings.

3. **Push your Changes**

   Make sure to update affected tests and/or add tests to any new features you may have created.

   We are very careful to make sure coverage does not drop.

4. **Create a Pull Request**

   We will review your changes and possibly start a discussion.

   If changes are required, you can simply push these changes into your fork by repeating steps #3 and #4 and the pull request is updated automatically.
